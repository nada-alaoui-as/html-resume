        <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <p>I'm a 20-year-old Moroccan student currently studying at the National School of Arts and Crafts of Rabat.
             My academic focus revolves around the exciting intersection of data science, artificial intelligence,
            and digital health engineering. Beyond my studies, I'm an avid coder, constantly expanding my skills 
            and embracing new challenges in programming. The world of coding fascinates me, and I take joy in crafting 
            efficient and elegant code to solve complex problems. Poetry is another passion of mine, offering a creative 
            outlet amid algorithms and data sets. Communication is crucial to me, both in the tech world and personal interactions.
            I believe in translating complex technical concepts into accessible language for effective collaboration.
            My journey as a student is a narrative weaving together a love for technology, coding, poetry, and communication. 
            I'm enthusiastic about shaping my path in data science and artificial intelligence, driven by a passion to make a 
            meaningful impact on the world.</p>
